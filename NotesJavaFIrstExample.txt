1.Class in java: A java class is the concept of Object Oriented Programming which follows a structure which contains
variables,methods and constructors in java.It helps in decreasing code duplicacy and enables functions of code reuseability.
Class could be public,private,protected if nothing is specified then it falls in category of default.Class can only be
accessed by the object of the class, all the calls to the methods.
##Snippet code##
public class MyClass{
}

2.Constructors in java: constructors are special methods of the class which gets called each time a class's object is
initialized.Constructors can be overloaded with different paramterts in the definition, A class can have multiple constructors
overloaded with differen set of parameters.Constructors doesn't have any return type(it never returns anything).Generally it is
used for initialization purposes.
##Snippet code##
public class MyClass{
String name;
MyClass(){
}
MyClass(String name){
this.name=name;
}
}

3.This keyword in Java:This keyword in java refers to the current object of the class(it refers to the object which is
currently accessing the class).When using muliple objects of the same class sometimes not using this keyword may result conlicts
in names with properties and methods.

4.Object in java: Object is instance of the class which is used to access the methods and properties of the class.
MyClass object;// here object is the instance of the class MyClass 
object.display();//here we are accessing the method dislay from class MyClass with help of "object" object.

Don't forget to practice the code by yourself and study the notes.
